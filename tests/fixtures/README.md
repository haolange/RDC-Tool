# `tests/fixtures/`

This directory contains small public `.rdc` captures used only by repository tests.

Current fixture set:

Policy:

- Only small public captures with clear source and license may live here.
- Do not copy developer-local, private, customer, or large `.rdc` files into this repository.
- Do not write developer-machine absolute capture paths into source, docs, tests, or release metadata.
- These fixtures are test-only and must not be included in release packages.
- Attribution for copied MIT assets is tracked in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

Full local or Android remote smoke may still pass an explicit external capture path to CLI smoke commands when a real RenderDoc runtime/device is available:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke_cli.sh --rdc "C:/path/sample.rdc" --context cli-smoke
```
